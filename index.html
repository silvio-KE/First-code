            Hello. Welcome to my first CSS and HTML web. I hope you will 
            enjoy my design of this page.
            However if you wont, 
            you're one of a kind. It will be very helpful if you sent me a feedback via the 
            contact page on what I could have done better or changed. I am a
            beginner and such information will be very helpful to me. 
            Thank you very much for dropping by!
        </p>
