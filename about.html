           My name is Silvio Omutsiambo. I first knew programming when I was 
           19 but became more interested in it
           at 23 years old. I have then strived to learn every 
           bit of programming I came across, thirsty to make
           it a career. Currently I am pursuing a Bachelors 
           Degree in Applied Mathematics at Machakos University. Probably in my
           final year. Besides programming I like nature walks, 
           and reading. I can practically walk in a green forest until its dark!
           Maybe I am connected to nature in some way, 
           I don't know. My career goal is to be a 
           fullstack developer. The journey has just began.
